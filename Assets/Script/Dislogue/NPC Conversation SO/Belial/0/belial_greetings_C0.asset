  - Good day, Alf. Nice to see you so lively today.
  - But now, I have some important issues to inform you.
  - Before that, I am afraid that Master Goye have something to tell you too,
  - He is standing under the Sun Tower, I think you will not miss him if you go directly
    west.
  - So, I bet you would like to go to him first.

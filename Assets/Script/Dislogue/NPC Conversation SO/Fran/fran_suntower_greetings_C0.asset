  - I have been waiting for you, come here Alf, there are a lot of things I have
    not told you yet.
  - 'This land is far away from any known civil cities for a long time to come. '
  - 'Both me and Master Belial have lost the grasp of the time, '
  - even since we both were the very first to reside in here.
  - 'Yet we built this tower, both in worship towards the God and providing energy
    to this village, '
  - so that the multitude sent here wont suffered from hunger and coldness.
  - 'But now, its time for you, the heir to the throne, '
  - go forth and bare the quest which I barely want to trouble a little kid like
    you.
  - But the time is short, and you are the only blue blood who is worthy in this
    adventure.
